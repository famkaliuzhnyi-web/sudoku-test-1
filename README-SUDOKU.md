# Sudoku with Web Workers

A React + TypeScript application demonstrating web workers for background computation. This application serves as a foundation for mobile app replacement with efficient background processing.

## Features

- **React + TypeScript**: Modern React application with full TypeScript support
- **Web Workers**: Background computation for Sudoku solving, validation, and puzzle generation
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Real-time Processing**: Non-blocking UI while performing computationally intensive tasks
- **Multiple Difficulties**: Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzle generation
- **Interactive Board**: Click-to-edit Sudoku grid with validation feedback

## Web Worker Capabilities

The application includes a dedicated web worker (`public/sudoku.worker.js`) that handles:

- **Puzzle Generation**: Creates random Sudoku puzzles based on difficulty level
- **Puzzle Solving**: Uses backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles
- **Puzzle Validation**: Checks if the current board state is valid
- **Background Processing**: All computations run in a separate thread, keeping the UI responsive

## Architecture

### Components
- `App.tsx`: Main application component
- `SudokuBoard.tsx`: Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid component
- `LoadingSpinner.tsx`: Loading indicator component

### Custom Hooks
- `useWebWorker.ts`: Generic web worker management hook
- `useSudokuWorker.ts`: Specialized hook for Sudoku operations

### Styling
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first design
- Glass-morphism effect with backdrop filters
- Gradient backgrounds optimized for modern browsers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sudoku-test-1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Mobile App Ready

This application is designed to be easily converted to a mobile app using:
- **Capacitor**: For native mobile app deployment
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities
- **React Native**: Code can be adapted for React Native

The web worker architecture ensures smooth performance on mobile devices by offloading computational tasks from the main thread.

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with Web Worker support
- Mobile Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile
- Desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Performance

- Web workers prevent UI blocking during puzzle solving
- Responsive design optimized for touch interfaces
- Efficient rendering with React's virtual DOM
- Minimal bundle size with code splitting

## Technical Implementation

### Web Worker Communication
The application uses a robust message-passing system between the main thread and web worker:

```typescript
// Sending a message to the worker
const result = await sendMessage('generate', { difficulty: 'medium' });

// Worker processes and responds
self.onmessage = function(e) {
  const { type, data, id } = e.data;
  // Process request and send response
  self.postMessage({ id, type: 'success', result });
};
```

### TypeScript Integration
Full TypeScript support with strict typing for web worker communication:

```typescript
interface WorkerMessage {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  data?: any;
}

interface WorkerResponse {
  id: string;
  type: 'success' | 'error' | 'ready';
  result?: any;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly interface with 40px+ touch targets
- Responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Efficient memory usage for mobile devices
